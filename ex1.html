Write an app that asks the user to input his name in an text input, and
immediately - as they type - says Hello back to them and reports the number of characters in his name. Hints at the bottom of this file. For example, "Hello, Elaine! There are 6 letters in your name."

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Characters in Your Name</title>
    <script src="angular.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div ng-app>
      What's your name?
      <input type="text" ng-model="name"><br>
      <label>Hello, {{name}}!</label>
      <label>Your name is {{name.length}} characters long.</label>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

















<!--
Hints: look at angular-examples/1-hello-world.html for the structure. You can use the `.length` property to get the number
of characters in a string. It even works in an AngularJS expression: `{{name.length}}`.
